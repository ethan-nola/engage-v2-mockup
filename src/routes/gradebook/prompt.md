I need to add another unique use-case to the gradebook. Please examine the following rules describing the logic of diagnostic days.

- Diagnostic days are a set of 4 groups of assessments and presentations. In each group:
  - "Diagnostic" is the first assessment in a group.
  - "Presentation" is the second component in a group.
  - "Mastery a" and "Mastery b" are the last two assessments in a group.
- If the student gets 100% on a group's diagnostic:
  - they can skip to the next group. (where they would take the diagnostic for that group)
- If the student does **not** get 100% on the group's diagnostic:
  - they must stay on the current group and watch that group's presentation.
  - They then take that group's first mastery assessment ("Mastery a").
  - If they pass "Mastery a" they can move on to the next group.
  - If they fail "Mastery a" they must stay on the current group and take the second mastery assessment ("Mastery b").
  - If they pass "Mastery b" they can move on to the next group.
  - If they fail "Mastery b" they are considered "locked" and must wait for the teacher to unlock them.
