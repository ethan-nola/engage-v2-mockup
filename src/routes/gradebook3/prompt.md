I need to better represent a realistic gradebook scenario. Please examine the following rules for how a normal classroom grades snapshot would look.
- The Students can take Units in any order
- Students can only take one unit at a time
- When a student starts a unit they must complete all lessons in the unit before they can move on to a different unit.
- If a student hasnt taken a lesson assessment, the lesson grade should be undefined (or blank in the UI)
- All of a lesson's presentations and assessments must be completed before the lesson grade can be calculated.
- The unit grade can show a grade even while a student has not completed all lessons in the unit. In this case the unit grade should be the average of the completed lessons.
