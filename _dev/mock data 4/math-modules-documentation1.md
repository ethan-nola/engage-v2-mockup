# Math Modules: Course Structure and Implementation Guide

## Course Overview
Math Modules is a comprehensive K12 eLearning program structured into 10 thematic units, each covering content equivalent to a traditional textbook chapter. The program combines instructional sessions with diagnostic assessments to ensure concept mastery.

## Course Structure
The course contains 10 units, each exploring distinct mathematical themes:
- Forensic Math
- Environmental Math
- Properties of Math
- Chemical Math
- Math Behind Your Meals
- Geometric Packing
- Factoring & Polynomials
- Laser Geometry
- Gravity of Algebra
- Home Makeover

## Unit Structure and Progression
Each unit consists of 10 instructional days divided into two types: Session Days and Diagnostic Days. This structure ensures systematic progression through new content while providing opportunities for concept mastery and remediation.

### Session Days
Session Days (Days 1-4, 6-7, and 10) focus on delivering new mathematical concepts within the unit's scope. They follow two formats:

Standard Sessions (Days 1-4):
- Research, Challenge, and Assess (RCA) component
- Instructional presentation introducing new concepts

Modified Sessions:
- Day 6: Presentation only
- Day 7: Post-test assessment followed by presentation
- Day 10: Enrichment session offering extra credit opportunities or additional time for completion of previous work

### Diagnostic Days: Deep Dive
Diagnostic Days (Days 5 and 9) serve as critical checkpoints in each unit, occurring after key learning segments to ensure concept mastery. Each Diagnostic Day is a 90-minute period structured to identify and address knowledge gaps through a systematic assessment and remediation process.

#### Structure and Components
Each Diagnostic Day contains four distinct assessment groups. These groups operate independently but follow the same four-step progression:

1. Initial Diagnostic Assessment
   The first step evaluates student understanding of specific concepts covered in previous sessions. Students who achieve 100% demonstrate full mastery and advance directly to the first diagnostic assessment of the next group, effectively "testing out" of that group's remediation process. Students scoring below 100% continue to the remediation phase within their current group.

2. Remedial Lesson Presentation
   This targeted instruction session serves as a "just-in-time refresher" for students who didn't achieve full mastery in the diagnostic assessment. The presentation focuses specifically on concepts identified as challenging in the diagnostic assessment, providing focused remediation before students attempt to demonstrate mastery.

3. First Mastery Assessment
   Following remediation, students take their first mastery assessment. A score of 100% indicates successful remediation, allowing students to advance to the next group's diagnostic assessment. Students scoring below 100% proceed to a second attempt at demonstrating mastery.

4. Second Mastery Assessment
   This final opportunity to demonstrate mastery serves as a crucial decision point. Students achieving 100% advance to the next group's diagnostic assessment. However, students scoring below 100% face a progression lock, requiring instructor intervention before continuing.

#### Progression and Flow
The diagnostic day process is designed to be both rigorous and flexible:
- Students can complete different numbers of components based on their performance
- At minimum, a student must take each group's diagnostic assessment
- At maximum, a student might need to complete all four steps in each group
- Instructor intervention is specifically required only when a student cannot achieve mastery after two attempts
- The system automatically advances students who demonstrate mastery at any point

#### Relationship to Session Days
Diagnostic Days are strategically placed to assess cumulative understanding:
- Diagnostic Day 1 (Day 5) evaluates concepts taught in Sessions 1-4
- Diagnostic Day 2 (Day 9) assesses material covered in Sessions 6-8
- This placement ensures timely identification of learning gaps before advancing to new concepts

## Implementation Timeline
- Each day requires one class period
- Unit duration: 10 class periods
- Complete course duration: 100 school days (10 units Ã— 10 days)

## Student Progression Requirements
Students must progress sequentially through the course components:
- Complete each Session Day's components in order
- During Diagnostic Days, students can bypass remediation by achieving 100% on initial diagnostics
- Instructor intervention is required after failing both mastery assessments
- Unit completion is required before advancing to subsequent units

## Assessment Types
The program employs five distinct assessment types:
1. Research, Challenge, and Assess (RCA): Prepares students for new material
2. Diagnostic: Evaluates understanding of previously covered concepts
3. Mastery: Confirms concept mastery after remediation
4. Post-test: Comprehensive evaluation of unit concepts
5. Module Guide: Initial assessment of prerequisite knowledge
